<p>One sunny afternoon, you, having studied desperately in school, returned to your dorm.</p>
<p>Lying against the chair, you decided to search for an interesting game to kill time and have fun.</p>
<p><img src="../images/yizi.png" width="469" height="258" alt=""/>
</p>
<p>All of a sudden, you noticed a game about tanks&nbsp;in the app store.</p>
<p>Like this:</p>
<p><img src="../images/2024021222283371976.png" width="216" height="216" alt=""/></p>
<p>And it's old promotional images.(You didn't know that it's far from the true effects in the game.)</p>
<p><img src="../images/xuanchuan.jpg" width="687" height="307" alt=""/></p>
<p>Looks funny and absurd right?</p>
<p>But you decided to give it a shot. </p>
<p>For it's actually like a harmless shooting game which garantees PLEASURE, and requires LOW techniques.</p>
