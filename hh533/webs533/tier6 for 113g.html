<p>Here I'll tell you about the rules. </p>
<p>You should choose the right tank to battle&nbsp;with. If you lose, you'll restart.</p>
<p>If you think the enemy tanks are so strong that your tank can't even destroy each one of them, click &quot;RUN&quot;.</p>
<p>However if there's a tank you can destroy but you choose to run, you'll defeat and restart.</p>
<p>Each successful round upgrades your tank till it reaches tier X and you win.</p>
<p>Your tank:</p>
